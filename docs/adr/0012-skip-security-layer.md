# 12. Setup security

Date: 2019-03-23

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We should create a secure application. Also, it works in the context
of the given customer, so we need some how identify
which customer rents or returns films

## Decision

We skip security layer for now, since it's irrelevant for this proof of concept.
We identify customer from request parameters

## Consequences

- Anybody can make rental related operation as any customer
