# 5. Assume films are always available for rental

Date: 2019-03-19

## Status

Accepted

## Context

In regular video rental store there's always a limited set of film copies but in the task specification there's no mention about it.

## Decision

We assume that films are always available for rental, i.e. we have unlimited number of film copies

## Consequences

- We don't have to calculate number of available copies before the rental which makes system simpler
